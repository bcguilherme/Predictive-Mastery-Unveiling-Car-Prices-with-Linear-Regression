Car Price Analysis with Linear Regression
Welcome to our exploration of car prices through the lens of linear regression techniques. The primary objective of this project is to predict car prices based on a myriad of features. Below is a captivating overview of the steps undertaken in this endeavor:

Data Preparation
Our journey begins by importing car data from a CSV file. The dataset undergoes meticulous preprocessing, ensuring the normalization of numeric features through the application of a MinMax scaler.

Linear Regression Modeling
In crafting our predictive model, we turn to the sophisticated capabilities of the statsmodels library. This robust linear regression model is meticulously tailored to forecast car prices, considering various variables, including technical specifications and other salient information.

Model Evaluation
To gauge the efficacy of our model, we strategically partition the data into training and testing sets, deploying the train_test_split function. The linear regression model is then diligently trained on the designated training dataset, and its prowess is scrutinized on both the training and test datasets.

Results and Metrics
The fruits of our modeling efforts unfold with compelling metrics:

R-squared (RÂ²): A formidable 86.24% of the variance in car prices is successfully elucidated by our model.
Evaluation Metrics on Training Data:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X.XXXXX
Mean Squared Error (MSE): X.XXXXX
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): X.XXXXX
Evaluation Metrics on Test Data:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X.XXXXX
