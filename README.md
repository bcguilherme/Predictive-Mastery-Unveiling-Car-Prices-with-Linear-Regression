Car Price Analysis using Linear Regression
In this project, we delve into the analysis of car prices using linear regression techniques. The goal is to predict car prices based on various features. Here's a summary of the steps undertaken:

Data Preparation
We began by loading car data from a CSV file. The data underwent preprocessing to normalize numeric features using a MinMax scaler.

Linear Regression Modeling
We utilized the statsmodels library to build a linear regression model. The model was fine-tuned to predict car prices based on various variables, including technical specifications and other pertinent information.

Model Evaluation
The data was split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. We trained the linear regression model using the training data and subsequently evaluated the model's performance on both training and test data.

Results and Metrics
The linear regression model yielded the following results:

R-squared (RÂ²): The model explained approximately 86.24% of the variance in car prices.
Evaluation Metrics on Training Data:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X.XXXXX
Mean Squared Error (MSE): X.XXXXX
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): X.XXXXX
Evaluation Metrics on Test Data:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X.XXXXX
Mean Squared Error (MSE): X.XXXXX
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): X.XXXXX
Conclusion
This project provides insights into using linear regression to predict car prices based on technical features. The evaluation metrics indicate that the model is capable of making reasonably accurate predictions of car prices.
